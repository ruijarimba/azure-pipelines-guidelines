# ‚ùå DO NOT: use AzureKeyVault task

Do not use the `AzureKeyVault` task in pipelines to retrieve sensitive
information.

[DO NOT: Use AzureKeyVault task](https://ruijarimba.visualstudio.com/ruijarimba/_git/azure-pipelines-guidelines?path=/guidelines/steps/dont-use-azurekeyvault-task.md&version=GBfeature/180-initial-guidelines)
```

## Reason

The `AzureKeyVault` is used to fetch the values of secrets from an Azure Key
Vault and set them as **pipeline variables** that can be used in subsequent
tasks. This creates a coupling between the steps and the variables.

See [AVOID: Using variables in steps templates](../steps/avoid-variables.md).

## Recommended Approach

Use variable groups linked to an Azure Keyvault.

Reference them within variables templates and pass them as parameters to the
steps templates.
