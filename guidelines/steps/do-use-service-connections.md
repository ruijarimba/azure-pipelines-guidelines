# âœ… DO: Use service connections when possible

Use Service Connections when possible to connect to external services,
like Azure, GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, and many other services.

## Reason

Service connections provide a secure mechanism to connect to external services
without the need to pass in secret variables to the build directly.
