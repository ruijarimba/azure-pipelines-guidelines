# âœ… CONSIDER: Declaring Variables as Read-only

Consider declaring variables as read-only when these are not intended to be
modified after initialization.

```

## Reason

Read-only variables can prevent accidental modification and clearly indicate
that the value should not change during pipeline execution.

## Example

```yaml
variables:
  - name: myReadOnlyVar
    value: myValue
    readonly: true
```
